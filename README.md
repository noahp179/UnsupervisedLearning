Breast Cancer Prediction using Unsupervised Learning Methods


This GitHub project focuses on leveraging unsupervised learning methods for the early detection of breast cancer. By employing techniques such as Logistic Regression and K-means Clustering, the project aims to analyze tumor characteristics and make predictions about the likelihood of breast cancer.

Key Features:

- Logistic Regression Analysis: Implementing logistic regression to model the probability of breast cancer based on various tumor attributes. The model will be trained on labeled datasets to capture the underlying patterns associated with malignant and benign tumors.

- K-means Clustering: Utilizing K-means clustering to group tumors into distinct clusters based on shared characteristics. This can aid in identifying common traits among cancerous tumors and facilitate a more nuanced understanding of the dataset.

- Feature Engineering: Employing feature engineering techniques to enhance the predictive power of the models. This includes selecting relevant features, handling missing data, and normalizing variables to ensure robust and accurate predictions.

- Data Visualization: Providing insightful visualizations to help users understand the distribution of data, the effectiveness of the models, and the correlation between different tumor attributes.

- Model Evaluation: Implementing thorough model evaluation metrics to assess the performance of both the Logistic Regression and K-means Clustering models. This ensures the reliability and accuracy of the predictions.

- Documentation: Comprehensive documentation to guide users through the project, including detailed explanations of the algorithms, instructions for data preprocessing, and guidelines for model interpretation.

- Interactivity: Incorporating user-friendly interfaces to enable users to interact with the models, input their data, and obtain predictions for new tumor cases.
